# CryptoClustering
Module 19 -- Unsupervised Learning\
\
In this project, we use Python to create unsupervised learning models to analyze and predict future prices of Cryptocurrencies.\
\
We used a provided csv data file, scaled the data, and used HvPlot and Python to visualize this data.  We used the data to train the model and produce clustering using KMeans to analyze. \
\
Also used in this exercise was the elbow method to find the optimal amount of clusters for the KMeans algorithnm, and PCA to show an alternative analysis/visualization.
